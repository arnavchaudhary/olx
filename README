OLXDown is a web crawler / web scraper / grabber for site http://olx.ua/.
OLXDown is a part of mach bigger machine learning project which learns from advertisements grabbed from olx.ua.
It is created for learning purposes only !!!

PURPOSE:
Unfortunately existing GitHub projects for scraping olx.ua are very slow.
So I decided to write my own scraper that would benefit from scala and akka multitasking allowing to download ads with much better performance.
The key difference from other scrapers is that it allows you to download several advertisements simultaneously.
What program actually does - it scraps ads and save them into `down` folder. This folder must exist before you run the app !
Storage format is JSON text.

COMPILE:
    (1) Install Scala Build Tool. http://sbt.org
    (2) CD to project folder. Where build.sbt file is located. Run sbt run

Usage:
